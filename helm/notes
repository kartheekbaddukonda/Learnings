Tiller: 
>   tiller is the cluster component of helm.
>   it interacts directly with k8s API server to install, upgrade , query and remove k8s resources.
>   it also stores objects that represents releases
>   it typically installed by running the command helm init and lives in kube-system namespace (unless instructed otherwise)

3 main components of HELM are : chart, repository , release

Chart:

>   For list of k8s resources you can use link: https://github.com/helm/charts (it contains stable and incubator charts)

Repository:
>   is a place where charts can be collected and shared.

Release: 
>   A release is instance of chart running in k8s cluster, one chart can often be installed many times in the same cluster, each time it is installed a new release is created.
