> Revert to a previous version
> collaborate and share changes
> Combine changes

* git config --global user.name "Kartheek"
* git config --global user.email kartheekb@gmail.com

some linux basic commands you should know:
-------------------------------------------

-   ls (list) , ls -a (list hidden files) , ls -la  (long list)  | ls abcd | ls abcd/xyz
-   pwd (print working directory)
-   cd (Change directory) / cd .. (to go back one level)
-   touch (create a new file)
-   mkdir (make a directory)
-   rm (remove) , rm -rf (remove recursive and force for folders)
-   open . (mac) / start . | open abcd
-   clear (clear screen)
-   tab (keyboard shortcut to auto complete)
-   esc i > add text > esc :wq! (write and quit)

GIT:
^^^^^
    basics:
    --------
        Prctice will be a diff directory in this laptop.
        folder name: git_practice
            git status
            git init (make a folder per repo and initialize, thats it)

        working area > git add > staging area > git commit > Repository > git push > remote repository

        do the work

        git add . (or git add file1 file2 file3 etc. for adding specific files to staging area)
        git commit (it will prompt for message)
        git commit -m "initial commit" (what ever staged can be committed to repository)
        git rm --cached file1 file2 etc. ( to remove from staging area and back to working area)

        >   keep your commits atomic (the smaller commit the easier it is rollback)
        >   commit messages should be present tense (not by law by convention)
        >   always use editor than default vim that comes along with git. (its tedious task)
            *   git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
        >   cmd + shift + P for command pallet  : shell command : install code command in path

            git log --abbrev-commit
            git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline

        GUI (gitkraken)

        >   git commit --amend (you can fix typo in commit messge, you can add missing files etc.)
        (note that it is applicable for one commit ago, not some few commits ago)
        * make sure to add (git add xyz) files before amend

        ignoring files: ex: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android

        >   sensitive data like secrets, API keys, credentials etc.
        >   OS files
        >   log files
        >   Dependencies and packages etc.

        another way of adding and committing in 1 liner:

        git commit -a -m "one liner for add and commit"
        note that if the file is empty it will not add, then u should use git add. and commit seperately

    Branching:
    -----------
        git log

        commit b2667f84f1e6a47c458dbbfd4b378c8dfb258168 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
        Author: kartheek <kartheekb@gmail.com>
        Date:   Tue Jul 13 23:17:56 2021 +0530

            added branching pdf

        HEAD -> master : here HEAD is a pointer that refers to our current location in the repository
        HEAD is a reference to the tip of the branch pointer
        can be imagined as bookmars in a book

        git branch (will list all branches) - see *
        git branch <branch-name> - will create a branch for you
        -   (branch names can not have spaces)
        -   ( not that your HEAD and branch still refers to Master (or any other branch) / main only , you have to switch exclusively)
        - git branch will create a branch based on HEAD where it is currently at.s
        git log (shows where HEAD is pointing now along with branch ofcourse as tehy both point to same HEAD when you create a branch)

        to switching between branches:
        >   git switch  <Branch name>
        >   git checkout <Branch name> [older way]

        to create and switch in one go:
        >   git switch  -c <Branch name>
        >  git checkout -b <Branch name> [older way]

        switching branches with unstaged changes:

        > try to switch branches whith some unstaged changes on same file in current branch
        - we either have to commit or stash them. (its called a conflict)

        > try to switch branches whith some unstaged changes with new file in current branch
        - we can switch easyly as the new file is not known to current branch

        recommendation is to always commit your changes in current branch

        deleting a branch:

        git branch -d  / --delete (if already merged)
        git branch -D / --delete --force (if you are sure you wnat to dlete without merge)
        note: you cant delete a branch which u are in currently

        rename branch:

        > git branch -m  <new name>
        note: to rename you have to be in that branch

        git branch -v gives more information about all branches with trim sha and opeliner last commit message

    Merging:
    ---------
        note:
        1. we merge branches, not commits
        2. we always merge to the current HEAD branch
        ex: i have master and bugfix branches, to merge bugfix changes to master , you should be in receiving branch in this case master.
        3. if your master's HEAD is still at a position where you created an initial branch, merging would be easy and its called fast-forward merging
        4. they are not forever in sync. its for the moment

        fast-forward:
            git switch master (the branch where i want something to be merged to)
            git merge bugfix

        as new merge commit from git- recursive strategy:
            when your destination branch is ahead of your source branch, you can still apply the same command.
            git will create a new commit for you.

        resolve conflicts and merge:
        u can use you CLI (default editor), GUI , IDE to manually rectify the conflict.

        once merged you can delete the merged branch.
        note merged commits will have 2 parents

    git diff:
    ----------
        it doesnt perform anything to your repository , it is just am informative cli option for better understanding
        of what has been changed between branches, between working area to statging , staging to local and local to
        remote repos.
        ex:
        diff --git a/3.txt b/3.txt   (a is old file, b is new file)
        index 542323c..5069130 100644 ( internl reference to these files)
        --- a/3.txt  (old)
        +++ b/3.txt  (old)
        @@ -1,7 +1,7 @@  (Chunk header)
        You may be shocked to learn that we had a hard time deciding on 10.
        So, being captains of our own destiny, we decided we were allowed to pick 20 . . .
        plus almost that many dissents. We did not allow reissues, otherwise you had better believe

        list twice as long. (My beloved Sweet Days of Discipline, certainly in the top ten novels

        >   git diff   (viewing unstaged changes)
        >   git diff HEAD (viewing working directory changes - it includes staged and unstaged changes)
        >   git diff --staged (or)
            git diff --cached (viewing only staged changes)
        >   git diff branch1..branch2 (viewing differences between 2 branches, order matters b1 becomes a , b2 becomes b)
            git diff branch1 branch2
        >   git diff commit1..commit2 (viewing differences between commits, order matters c1 becomes a , c2 becomes b) )
            git diff commit1 commit2
        we can use diff to a specific file as well
        >   git diff HEAD file1.txt
        >   git diff --staged file1.txt

    Stashing:
    ------------
        scenario1: if there are files which are unstaged and you have to switch branch , git will let you with 'M' as indication
        when the modified file dont conflict with your current switch.

        scenario2: if there are files which are unstaged and you have to switch branch , git wont let u in if it identifies any conflict.

        >   git stash (or git stash save) - all files which are not committed yet will be stashed and make your working tree, staging area clean
        >   git stash pop   - the stashed changes will appear back
        >   git stash apply - whatever has been stashed will be applied but unlike pop it wont clean up the stashed history.

        you can have multiple stashes

        >   git stash list (will list the stashed list)
        >   git stash apply stash@{2}
        >   git stash drop stash@{1}
        >   git stash clear (will clear everything)


    time travel: (restore, reset, revert, rebase)  
    ---------------------------------------------

        checking out to specific commit:
        ********************************
        git checkout <abbrev comit or full sha>  - it will land you in to detached HEAD
        purpose/ Options:
        you can detach HEAD and examine the commit
        you can re-attach HEAD back simply by using: git switch <branch>
        you can branchoff from a specific commit : 1. git checkout <abbrevsha> 2. git switch -c <new branch>
        you can also position your HEAD to specific commit using HEAD~ : git checkout HEAD~1 (will take your HEAD position to 1 step back ,etc.)
        when you have multiple branches with detached HEADs the easiest way to attach back is : git switch -

        Discarding changes with checkout:
        *********************************
        supoose you made some changes to multiple files and you dont want to keep them and to revert to previous commit how they are use this option.
        >   git checkout HEAD <filename>
            git checkout  -- <file1> <file2> ..
        git restore (which is a new command also does the same along with additional stuff)

        Restore:
        *********
        >   git restore <filename> [by default it restores with current HEAD]
        [gotach: git status after adding new files to working area will tell you about this ]
        you can go to specific HEAD position also using restore
        >   git restore --source HEAD~2 <filename> [if you want to restore with specific head use this]
        Assue you have staged few files out of which you want some to be carried over and some to be trashed back to working area
        >   git restore --staged <filename1> <filename2> (pass the file names which you want to trashout)
        [gotach: git status after git add . will tell you about this ]

        NOTE:
        git add .
        git checkout HEAD file.txt = git restore --staged file.txt + git restore file.txt

        reset:
        *******
        suppose you made few commits to your master branch but you actually meant to commit to a different branch
        you can use git rest to undo the commit.
        >   git reset <commit hash /sha> (plain reset)
        Note: plain reset removes the commit , but wont removes the changes from working area, this is useful
        when you need those changes for another branch
        >   git reset --hard <commit hash /sha> (hard reset)
        Note: hard reset removes the commit and also removes the changes from working area, this is useful
        when totally want to get rid of the changes.

        revert:
        ********

        both revert and reset will undo changes from a commit but they accomplish it different way
        reset - moves branch pointer backwards, elimiate commits
        revert -instead it creates a brand new commit which undo / reverse the changes from commit.
        (as its resulted in a new commit it asks for commit message)

        this is useful when working in colloboratively, history is still preserved.

    rebase:
    ********
    1.  it is used as alternate to merging
    2.  as a clean up tool using  - git rebase with squash 

github:
^^^^^^^^
its a hosting platform for git repositories, you can access from anywhere and share them with other people.
besides hosting github alos provides more features which are not native to git.

>   public and Private 
-   normal / community repos:  
    :   public is visible to everyone but they cant push or pull unless you add them as collaborator
    :   Private is only visible to people whom  you add them as collaborator

-   Enterprise repos:  
    :   public, everyone in the org can view, push and pull 
    :   Private everyone in the org can view, but only collaborators can push and pull 

create repos, add collaborators, make local cloes, push and pull.....
