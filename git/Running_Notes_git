Git Core:
----------
intro to Git
Installation
Git Basics
committing in detail
Branching
Merging

next level:
-------------
Diffing
Stashing
Undoing changes

tool specific:
---------------
github intro
fetching & pulling
github odds & ends
Collabrative workflow

The other parts:
-----------------
Rebasing
interactive Rebasing
git tags
git behind the scenes
reflogs
custom alias

what git helps us with:
-----------------------
> track changes across multiple files
> compare versions of a project
> time travel back to older versions
> Revert to a previous version
> collaborate and share changes
> Combine changes

* git config --global user.name "Kartheek"
* git config --global user.email kartheekb@gmail.com

some linux basic commands you should know:
-------------------------------------------

-   ls (list) , ls -a (list hidden files) , ls -la  (long list)  | ls abcd | ls abcd/xyz
-   pwd (print working directory)
-   cd (Change directory) / cd .. (to go back one level)
-   touch (create a new file)
-   mkdir (make a directory)
-   rm (remove) , rm -rf (remove recursive and force for folders)
-   open . (mac) / start . | open abcd
-   clear (clear screen)
-   tab (keyboard shortcut to auto complete)
-   esc i > add text > esc :wq! (write and quit)

basics:
--------

    Prctice will be a diff directory in this laptop.
    folder name: git_practice
        git status
        git init (make a folder per repo and initialize, thats it)

    working area > git add > staging area > git commit > Repository > git push > remote repository

    do the work

    git add . (or git add file1 file2 file3 etc. for adding specific files to staging area)
    git commit (it will prompt for message)
    git commit -m "initial commit" (what ever staged can be committed to repository)
    git rm --cached file1 file2 etc. ( to remove from staging area and back to working area)

    >   keep your commits atomic (the smaller commit the easier it is rollback)
    >   commit messages should be present tense (not by law by convention)
    >   always use editor than default vim that comes along with git. (its tedious task)
        *   git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
    >   cmd + shift + P for command pallet  : shell command : install code command in path

        git log --abbrev-commit
        git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline

    GUI (gitkraken)

    >   git commit --amend (you can fix typo in commit messge, you can add missing files etc.)
    (note that it is applicable for one commit ago, not some few commits ago)
    * make sure to add (git add xyz) files before amend

    ignoring files: ex: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android

    >   sensitive data like secrets, API keys, credentials etc.
    >   OS files
    >   log files
    >   Dependencies and packages etc.

    another way of adding and committing in 1 liner:

    git commit -a -m "one liner for add and commit"
    note that if the file is empty it will not add, then u should use git add. and commit seperately

Branching:
-----------

    git log

    commit b2667f84f1e6a47c458dbbfd4b378c8dfb258168 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
    Author: kartheek <kartheekb@gmail.com>
    Date:   Tue Jul 13 23:17:56 2021 +0530

        added branching pdf

    HEAD -> master : here HEAD is a pointer that refers to our current location in the repository
    HEAD is a reference to the tip of the branch pointer
    can be imagined as bookmars in a book

    git branch (will list all branches) - see *
    git branch <branch-name> - will create a branch for you
    -   (branch names can not have spaces)
    -   ( not that your HEAD and branch still refers to Master (or any other branch) / main only , you have to switch exclusively)
    - git branch will create a branch based on HEAD where it is currently at.s
    git log (shows where HEAD is pointing now along with branch ofcourse as tehy both point to same HEAD when you create a branch)

    to switching between branches:
    >   git switch  <Branch name>
    >   git checkout <Branch name> [older way]

    to create and switch in one go:
    >   git switch  -c <Branch name>
    >  git checkout -b <Branch name> [older way]

    switching branches with unstaged changes:

    > try to switch branches whith some unstaged changes on same file in current branch
    - we either have to commit or stash them. (its called a conflict)

    > try to switch branches whith some unstaged changes with new file current branch
    - we can switch easyly as the new file is not known to current branch

    recommendation is to always commit your changes in current branch

    deleting a branch:

    git branch -d  / --delete (if already merged)
    git branch -D / --delete --force (if you are sure you wnat to dlete without merge)
    note: you cant delete a branch which u are in currently

    rename branch:

    > git branch -m  <new name>
    note: to rename you have to be in that branch

    git branch -v gives more information about all brnches with trim sha and opeliner last commit message

Merging:
---------
note:
1. we merge branches, not commits
2. we always merge to the current HEAD branch
ex: i have master and bugfix branches, to merge bugfix changes to master , you should be in receiving branch in this case master.
3. if your master's HEAD is still at a position where you created an initial branch, merging would be easy and its called fast-forward merging
4. they are not forever in sync. its for the moment

fast-forward:
    git switch master (the branch where i want something to be merged to)
    git merge bugfix

recursive strategy:
    when your destination branch is ahead of your source branch, you can still apply the same command.
    git will create a new commit for you.

resolve conflicts and merge:




once merged you can delete the merged branch.
note merged commits will have 2 parents



git diff:
----------
