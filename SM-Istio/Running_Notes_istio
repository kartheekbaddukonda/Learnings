- But the problem here is k8s is good at managing pods but not good at giving a visibility of interconnection between the pods.
this is where service mesh will help.

so service mesh is an additionl layer which the calls will come to and go from pods alog with some mesh logic inside the sm layer.

mesh logic could be: telemetry (to gather metrics of individual network requests)

istio - injects a proxy container in each pod

istio system - is responsible for guiding proxy (which deployed in its own namespace)
it contains number of different pods which are responsible for ISTIO logic to work. pods like
-   pilot
-   citadel
-   gallient etc.
from version 1.5 Istio system had undergone a greater modification and got rid of all those pods and have only 1 pod (which has main logic)
istiod (istio deamon) - which was pilot earlier
istio system also have other pods which are for user interaction 

>   The proxies inside each pod collectively are called "data plane"
>   istio system is called "The control plane"

we should not perform any changes to have istio working (except few)
