vagrant init jasonc/centos7
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
----------------------------

bash          : GNU Bourne-Again SHell
ls            : list content in the current directory
ls -l         : (long listing format of list[ls])
pwd           : (present working directory)
.sh           : (it is not required to have .sh as file extension, it can be anything)
#!/bin/bash   : (#-sharp, !-bang , #! shebang) - followed by interpreter to use (in this case its bin/bash , other examples cane be : #!/bin/ruby , #!/usr/bin/python etc.)
#             : is a comment which is used for humans to give a context of what to expect from this specific code
echo          : displays the text followed by this echo in ' ' (single quotes)
rwx           : read, write and execute - these permissions comes in 3 sets(1st - the permission of owner , 2nd - group , 3rd - everyone in the system)
chmod         : used to modify permission (755 adds execute permission to owner, group and everyone)
              : r = 4 , w = 2 , x = 1
              : self - 7 (4+2+1) , group - 5 (4+1) , everyone - 5 (4+1)
              : we can use chmod -rwx as well
.             : represents current directory
/             : represents directory separator
mv s* d*      : move s -source d -destination : (used to rename)
              : ex- mv 123.sh abc.sh
touch         : create an empty file
type          : shows if a command is shell built in
              : type echo (type -a echo - list all info)
              : this means if something is shell built in we do not need to give full path to use it
              : u get help on built in shell commands by using help <built in command>
              : help echo
              : you can combine | less to get less information
              : help echo | less
man           : if the specific command is not shell built in and you want to know about that command u can use means
              : man uptime
q             : exit (From less / man)

- variable assignment does not require type specification , just assign. make sure there is no space between = and value
              : not by rule but by conventions variable are always upper case
              : ex: WORD='script' (single or double quotes work here as its a string)
              : variable naming convention is to have a meaningful name to it
              : can start with letter (WORD) or _ (_WORD) but can not start with a digit (3WORD), can not have - (A-WORD) or @ (E@MAIL)
$             : to get the value of a variable you can simply add $<KEY>
              : if you put " " u can expand , if you put '' exact value will be referenced
              : ex - WORD='script (echo "$WORD" - script , echo '$WORD' - $WORD)
              : u can combine variable with hard coded text (echo "This is a shell $WORD")
              : u can also use {} to reference variable, this is useful when appending extra text to a variable. (echo "${WORD}ing is fun")

- besides user created variables, lot of special variables come along with BASH called special variables (ex: UID, PWD etc.)
man bash     : will list all such variables
/            : as man uses vim or vi key binding u can use / to filter
?            : for reverse search
             : ex: man BASH and /UID to display first occurrence of UID , you can continue search by pressing enter
             : id -un, whoami are special programs that displays the current user details

- USERNAME=$(id -un) is also equivalent to USERNAME=`id -un` (with in tik signs)
- if UID=0 meaning user is root
- while using 'if'  if you see ; meaning its a end of line
             : if [[ "${UID} -eq o"]] ; then echo 'you are root user' ; else echo "the current user is: $(id -un)" ; fi

- by convention if a condition executes successfully the exit status is 0 , so you can use any non zero exit status to quit.

${?}         : is a special variable which returns the exit status of most recently executed command.

read         : is an inbuild method for user input / interaction
etc/login.defs : will contain the default settings while adding user
useradd      : to add user (ex: sudo useradd kb) , note that usernames are case sensitive meaning kb is different from KB or Kb
             : by convention all usernames are lowercase and can have numbers
             : -c to add comments (in general used to store full name)
             : -m to create a home directory to the user
             : -M not to create a home directory to the user (this is default)

userdel      : to delete user
su - un      : to change user

!v           : short cut to previous command starting with letter v (another example !m for man command which i executed)
!./          : short cut to previous execution

date         : prints the current date in this format (Thu May 20 06:33:26 EDT 2021)
|            : turns the output of previous command as input to command that follows the pipe (|)


sha1sum , sha256sum [...] are used to generate a unique number by taking big chunk of data
to see the installed programs in linux box u can use ls -l /user/bin  which will list all programs, which further we can trim as below
ls -l /user/bin/*sum - this will list all programs ends with sum in user/bin location

head         : gives the first 10 entries of a file (by default) , you can control the number of lines by passing -n(*)
             : head -n3 /etc/passwd - prints first 3 lines from the file /etc/passwd
             : head -c1 /etc/passwd - prints the first line first character

 -  to generate something random 
             : date +%s%N | sha256sum | head -c10
             : This converts the date with seconds and milliseconds to sha256 and print first 10 characters as output

shuf         : shuffle the data
fold         : fold -w / -c / -b   - will slice them to single characters and print 1 by 1 (-w eliminates a space at the end)

- SPECIAL_CHARACTER=$(echo '!@#$%^&*()_+=' | fold -w1 | shuf | head -c1 ) will give a random character every time from '!@#$%^&*()_+='

which/hash   : ex- which head (gives the path for head program)
             : The above command prints /usr/bin/head , but we can have our own program with the name head in a different location
             : to do so you need root privileges
             : sudo vim /usr/local/bin/head (add some script to it - #!/bin/bash echo 'hello') then as root give 755 for execution
             : now "which head" will print /usr/local/bin/head
             : to get rid of it just removing (sudo rm /usr/local/bin/head) this alone does not work as linux saves these locations
               in its hash tables and when u type -  type head
                  :  head is hashed (/usr/bin/head)
            : so we should rehash the linux tables using hash -r
basename    : it strips off the directory portion of a string passed to it
            : remember it wont check if file exists or not
dirname     : its the reverse of basename, it will display the directory and ignore last dir / file
            : like basename it also wont check if directory exists or not

              : [vagrant@addusers vagrant]$ basename /i/am/not/here
                here
              : [vagrant@addusers vagrant]$ dirname /i/am/not/here
                /i/am/not

-eq           : equals
-ne           : not equals
-lt           : less than
-gt           : greater than
-ge           : greated than or equals

${0}          : last executed command
${#}          : number of supplied argument(s) [command followed by arguments]
${1}, ${2} ...: first supplied argument, 2nd supplied argument so on
...           : ellipses (meaning so on)
${@}          : for each argument (every positional argument)
${*}          : treats all arguments as single argument (if you put them in double quotes as this:  "${*}")
true          : always return exit status 0
sleep         : delays execution for specified period (10s, .5s. 5, 10m, 1h )
shift         : shifts everything one place by default, if you want to shift 2 places u can specify that
HOSTNAME      : build in variable in bash

standard input  :      comes from keyboard or pipe   (FD 0) - file descriptor
standard output :      displayed on screen           (FD 1) - file descriptor
standard error  :      displayed on screen           (FD 2) - file descriptor

                : File descriptors are very useful while debugging,
                  - to print only stdin to file use 0>
                  - to print only stdout to file use 1>
                  - to print only errors to file use 2>
                : head -n1 /etc/passwd /fakefile > head.out 2> head.err
                  - this command execution will print output of /etc/passwd to head.out (note that we didnt specify 1> for head.out  as its default)
                  - as /fakefile doenst exist it error out and that error will be pushed to head.err
                  - so if you want to push both out and error to the same file use below syntax
 &>             :  head -n1 /etc/passwd /fakefile &> head.both

                : quickly 0< or < , 1> or > are same as they are by default. you have to explicity call 2> if you want error to be seperated
                  : like &> we have &| which can



>             : redirect the stdout to specified location
<             : redirect the stdin to a program (note that only 1 line can be read)
              : read LINE < ${FILE}
>>            : add additional content to existing (as new line(s))
 -n           : gives numbering (ex: head -n1 /etc/passwd | cat -n )
              : note that only standard output will be counted not the standard error , so to include standard error also to counting below command to be user
|& = 2>&1  - head -n10 /etc/passwd |& cat -n
> /dev/null   : convention is that we dont ant to see the output instead just discard it we use > /dev/null
&>             : The above command only discard stdout , so to discard stderr use 2> /dev/null , to discard both use &> /dev/null
>&            : & after > assumes that we are using file descriptor instead of file name
              : so , >&2 meaning the errors to be displayed to standard error.

Functions ---

1. you have to define a function before u use it (as it follows top down approach)
  - global variables / sourcing libraries can be kept before functions defined
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  #!/bin/bash
  log()  [or function log { .... }]
  {
      echo "You are watching this because u called the log function"
  }
  log
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
the above is a simple log function.

2. you can define local variables to a function (which is available to that function alone)
3. When you are using functions be aware of the scpoe of each variable 
4. Its best practice to use local inside functions for variables
4. you can make any variable to readonly by applying the keyword : readonly before varibale (EXL readonly NAME='Kartheek')


logger      : will add logging message to /var/log/messages
            : -t is a flag used to tag


- var survives the reboot for not loosing the data


-f            :  check file exists
-p            : supplying cp -p will preserve permissions and original timestamps
return        : if for function  (while exit is for entire script)


getops ---- for parsing command line arguments

((  ))        : used for arthematic operation expansions 
              : + for sum
              : - for substraction
              : * for multiplication
              : / for division  (bah doesnt support floating point arhtemetics ex: 6/4 returns 1)
              - external program like bc ( basic caluculator need to install in case working with numbers)
              - bc -l will open caluculator on the consloe  (cntrl D to exit)
              - or u can use | to send stdin to bc : echo 6 / 4 | bc -l
              : % for modulous (reminder)
              : ++ to increment
              : -- to decrment
              : += add to a variable (NUM += 5) [if NUM =1 NUM+=5 will be 6]
              : let, expr are shell builtins used as alternate syntax for (( ))
              
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ let NUM=2+1
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo ${NUM}
    3
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ NUM=$(expr 2 + 3 )
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo ${NUM}
    5
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ NUM=$(( 3 + 6 ))
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo ${NUM}
    9

OPTIND  : variable used to strip out the passed options using shift ${OPTIND -1}

locate  :  will locate the file / program .. it will look in local db 

so when add a new program or file sudo updatedb is handy to have that indexed

!! will execute previous command (usecase : sudo !! - will execure the same command using sudo)

gotcha : not command that all users can run will reside in /bin , where as adminstraton commands will reside in /sbin 

also we can use find to find the files or programs

--- find /usr/bin  (this will list directories, sub directories and files in them as well)
--- find /usr/sbin -name userdel
--- find / -name userdel 
--- find / -name userdel 2>/dev/null (to throw all stderros to null bucket)


userdel -------------------------- 

-f force even if user logged in
 if you see user in /home directory with uid meaning he doenst have a account log in associated with it

 cat /etc/login.defs (refer this for max uids allocation)

 userdel -r kb (-r also deletes home directory)

 tar is used to archive 
 tar -cf (c refers create and f refers file name to archive)  : [tar -cf destfilename.tar source] (tar -cf archived_videos.tar videos)
 tar -tvf ( t refres list contents of archive, v for verbose only) : tar -tvf archived_videos.tar
 tar -xf (x extract all files) :  tar -xf archived_videos.tar videos

we use gzip to compress
use gunzip to uncompress

tar -zcvf (c refers create and f refers file name to archive, z refers to compress)


 .. is the parent directory where we are at

 ../../ will take you to 2 directories back


to lock a user for some time period use .......


sudo chage -E 0 <username> 
sudo chage -E 0 kb

to unlock  

sudo chage -E -1 <username> 
sudo chage -E -1 kb

we could use "sudo passwod -l kb" to lock and "sudo passed -u kb" to unlock but mind it that this mechanism doesnot prevent
user logging using ssh key. so use chage.

----------------------------------------------------------

cut and awk

> cut is not a standalone builtin its a utility

cut by byte -b
cut by character -c 
cut by delimiter -d (Seperator can be , )
cut by fileds -f  (nothing but cut by columns)

we can mix them all together as well

all aboce requires a range 

    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo "https:/,/mynameiskartheek.com/sobit/nik/jash/family" | cut -d / -f1
    https:
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo "https:/,/mynameiskartheek.com/sobit/nik/jash/family" | cut -d / -f2
    ,
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo "https:/,/mynameiskartheek.com/sobit/nik/jash/family" | cut -d / -f3
    mynameiskartheek.com
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo "https:/,/mynameiskartheek.com/sobit/nik/jash/family" | cut -d / -f 4
    sobit
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo "https:/,/mynameiskartheek.com/sobit/nik/jash/family" | cut -d / -f5
    nik
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo "https:/,/mynameiskartheek.com/sobit/nik/jash/family" | cut -d / -f6
    jash
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo "https:/,/mynameiskartheek.com/sobit/nik/jash/family" | cut -d / -f7
    family
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ echo "https:/,/mynameiskartheek.com/sobit/nik/jash/family" | cut -d / -f8

    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ 

you can change the output delimiter by using flag --output-delimiter


    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ cut -d ':' -f 1,3  /etc/passwd | head -3
    root:0
    bin:1
    daemon:2
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ cut -d ':' -f 1,3 --output-delimiter=',' /etc/passwd | head -3
    root,0
    bin,1
    daemon,2
    [vagrant@localhost vagrant]$


[vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ cut -d ':' -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | head -3
root:0
bin:1
daemon:2

the same can be achieved using awk as below:

[vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ awk -F ':' '{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd | head -3
root 0
bin 1
daemon 2

notice that : is replaced with a space , reason is awk has a special builtin seperator OFS (Output Filed Seperator)
so we can use that OFS seperator to fill with our choice of delimeter

[vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ awk -F ':' -v OFS=',' '{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd | head -3
root,0
bin,1
daemon,2

u can achieve the same with out OFS as well as below:

[vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ awk -F ':'  '{print $1"," $5}' /etc/passwd | head -3
root,root
bin,bin
daemon,daemon

NOTE: with cut you cant control the result display order but using awk u can do it.

$NF in print will print last field , we can use $NF - 1  

------- netstat -nutl result

the above command gives give port information -n : to show numbers instead of names
u  - for udp
t  - tcp
l  - for listening port
4  - for tcp/udp v4
6  - tcp v6 



[vagrant@localhost vagrant]$ netstat -nutl
